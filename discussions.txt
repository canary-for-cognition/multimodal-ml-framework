- *** MOST IMPORTANT *** remove Caitlin's RedCAP API from settings.yaml

- master list of pids with tasks/modalities in a 1/0 format in a separate script. this would work as a    master list, so that the code can extract PIDs, based on the task/modality mentioned.

- have a PID reuse flag, or have the PIDs be saved in a specific naming format so that whenever same parameters are used the PIDextractor doesn't have to re-extract PIDs (maybe, since PID extraction doesn't take that long).

- add support for custom conditions that we may specify (custom conditions can refer to a specific set of participants, like if they were wearing glasses or not, etc).

- change naming scheme of output files

- better name for inner_list_of_pids

- use PID_extraction_method somehow (tie it up with custom conditions).
